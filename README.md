CodingDojo @ResearchGate
========================

The [CodingDojo] is for all developers in Berlin who want to improve
their coding skills by practicing them together with fellow programmers. It's all
about having fun while coding.

We always meet on the **last Thursday of the month** at 7pm in the offices of [ResearchGate].
