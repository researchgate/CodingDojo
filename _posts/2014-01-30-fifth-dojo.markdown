The [CodingDojo] @[ResearchGate] is back for a new year of coding and having fun.

**Registration** - Please let us know if you wanna join by sending a mail to dojo@researchgate.net
or adding your info directly to the [participants folder][participants].

**Agenda** - After the rather special dojo last time, this one might feel conventional. We'll solve a standard kata in pairs using different lanugages.

We're looking forward to seeing you on the **30th of January 2014** at **19:00** (until approx. 21:00) at ResearchGate's [headquarters].
