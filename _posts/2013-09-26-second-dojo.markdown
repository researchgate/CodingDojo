The [CodingDojo] @[ResearchGate] is for all developers in Berlin who want to improve
their coding skills by practicing them together with fellow programmers.

**Access Limited** - The number of participants is limited so make sure you book your seat by sending a mail to dojo@researchgate.net
or adding your info directly to the [participants folder][participants].

**Agenda** - This time we're gonna do some pair programming. So bring your laptop and [let us know][doodle] which language you would like to use.

We're looking forward to seeing you on the **26th of September 2013** at **19:00** (until approx. 21:00) at ResearchGate's [headquarters].
