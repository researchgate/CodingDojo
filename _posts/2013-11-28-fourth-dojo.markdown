The [CodingDojo] @[ResearchGate] is for all developers in Berlin who want to improve
their coding skills by practicing them together with fellow programmers.

As always - **no recruting event**.

**Access Limited** - The number of participants is limited so make sure you book your seat by sending a mail to dojo@researchgate.net
or adding your info directly to the [participants folder][participants].

**Agenda** - Our Agenda for this time is a bit christmas themed coding kata and we hopefully have a nice surprise for you.
This time we will have "bring your own language" event so everyone can use his language of choice.

We're looking forward to seeing you on the **28th of November 2013** at **19:00** (until approx. 21:00) in the ResearchGate [headquarter].
