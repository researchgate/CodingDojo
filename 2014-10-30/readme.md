Since the last dojo was a little too short notice, we'll tackle the two mathematical katas again: 
[Triangle Type](http://www.codewars.com/kata/triangle-type) and 
[Hyper Sphere](http://www.codewars.com/kata/hyper-sphere)

You can read the descriptions (and also solve them already) at [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com)

The primary language will be JavaScript, but it's not compulsory.
